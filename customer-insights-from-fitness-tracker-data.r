One graph was prepared in Google Spreadsheets.\n\n**Answers to the following questions are given:**\n1. What trainer types can we identify from the dataset?\n2. How big are these trainer types?\n3. What are their training preferences in terms of training intensity?\n4. Can the dataset reveal a new potential target audience?\n\n\nI used publically open dataset that was upploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) by user [MÃ¶bius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).\n\nThe dataset contains data from 33 fitness tracker users during 12th April - 12th May 2016 (31 days) who consented to the submission of personal tracker data. I use the table called \"daily.Activity_merged.csv\". Access full dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).\n\n<a id=\"13\"></a> <br>\n### Summary of findings\n\n![Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRRWrpn4PUtIw7uuR58QPc6hydo2o24IFX3jkPD5WG88j3i67RPgidCxqTfR7Qb3LK3G7OSvGu8c0ok/pubchart?oid=40373898&amp;format=image)\n\n* Majority of people in this data set are Hardcore trainers who track activities in Peak Zone heart rate levels\n* New target group identified: No Sporters\n* No Sporters is a segment of people who own a fitness tracker but barely track any sport activities with it\n* This may suggest there are other motivations to get a fitness tracker, not just monitoring sport performance data\n* By understanding why this segment buys fitness devices, the company can target a new audience group\n* Marketing content should be developed keeping in mind the differences in device usage and training intensity\n* Communicate with two tones of voice and two different messages: \n    * Hardcore trainers: highlight advanced sport performance features, visuals with high intentsity sports\n    * No Sporter: highlight wellness tracking features, visuals with low intensity sports or mindfulness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"20\"></a> <br>\n\n## 2.

Hardcore, Cardio and Fat Burn trainers track roughly the same amount of activity minutes in a month. The intensity differs.\n\n2. No Sports trainer types aren't completely inactive, as they do track some activity minutes. However, the training minutes account for only 8%. As comparison, Hardocre trainers' monthly activity minutes account for 22%.\n\n\n<a id=\"70\"></a> <br>\n\n## 7. Conclusions and recommendations\n\n1. Majority of people in this dataset are Hardcore trainers who track activities in Peak Zone heart rate levels.\n\n2. New potential target group: No Sporters. \n\n3. No Sporters is a segment of people who own a fitness tracker but barely track any sport activities with it. More research is needed to understand this segment, however, this behaviour may suggest there are other motivations to get a fitness tracker, not just monitoring sport performance data. By understanding why this segment buys fitness devices, the company can target a new audience group and open doors for future growth\n\n4. Different variations of marketing content & communication strategy is needed in order to appeal for different fitness tracker users.\n\n3. As No Sporters  track less active minutes, their motivation to buy a fitness tracking device most likely isn't the advanced sport performance features. Instead, they may be more keen of other health features, such as monitoring sleep and stress levels. Therefore promoting advanced wellness tracking features is an affective way of sparking their interest.\n\n4. As majority of No Sporters' training intensity is light, they most likely don't use the advanced sport tracking features. This should be kept in mind when developing the marketing content. If images or video is used, it should contain light intensity training and highlight how the device can improve their sleep quality and help reduce stress in order for them to relate and get interested.\n\n5. Based on Hardcore trainers' training intensity, they are likely open to marketing messages on how the device can help them increase performance and achieve better results. Image and video containing high intensity sports and ads that highlight the advanced sport features of the watch are recommended.\n\n\n<a id=\"71\"></a> <br>\n\n#### a) Limitations\n* As the analysis was done on a small sample on a 31day period, it may contain bias\n* Data did not contain any details on the participants' health status or demographics, which may explain inactivity\n* There is a chance participants were training but it was not tracked with a device\n* Training intensity is subjective and depending on the fitness level of a person\n* Getting data about app usage would be helpful to better understand what types of sports and tracking metrics are preferred\n\n<a id=\"72\"></a> <br>\n\n#### b) Suggestions for further research\n* Analysis should be reproduced again with a larger sample and longer timeframe to see if same pattern still exists\n* Analysis could be reproduced with data from another company to see if similar pattern exists\n* Qualitative research to understand why and how No Sporters use fitness trackers. Once the company understands No Sporters' motivation for having a fitness device, they can target new audienes with effective marketing communication. Perhaps with a new product tailored specifically for No Sporters' needs.\n\n\n\n### Thank you!
